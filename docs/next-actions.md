# Next Actions

Updated: 2026-05-11

This is the active handoff list for future sessions. It should stay short and
actionable; move completed design notes or implementation plans under
`docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/archive/` when they ship.

## Current State

- `main` was last pushed through
  `8d3ce3c feat: add topology edit failure reasons`.
- Core silent-failure hardening shipped so far:
  - `GraphControlError` result APIs for direct compiled mono/stereo graphs.
  - `HotSwapQueueError` result APIs for mono/stereo hot-swap queues.
  - `GraphTopologyQueueError` result APIs for mono/stereo topology edit queues.
  - runtime-control `GraphControlError` result APIs for mono/stereo hot-swap
    and topology wrapper controls.
  - browser graph queue/control paths expose last-error string/code helpers
    while preserving the boolean wasm ABI.
  - `BoundVoicePool` owns template validation and `ControlBindingMap` lifetime,
    so `PatternScheduler` no longer carries stale bindings.
  - remaining ambiguity-prone DSP/browser helper parameters are labelled:
    `Oscillator::process`, `DemoSource::tick_source`, browser `tick`, and
    browser `tick_source`. The generated interfaces also confirm the earlier
    `Oscillator::{process_waveform,tick,tick_waveform}`,
    `Gain::process`, `Clip::process`, `Pan::process`,
    `DspNode::stereo_gain`, and `DspNode::stereo_clip` labels.
  - topology queue diagnostics are settled on
    `InvalidEdit(index, reason)`, where `reason` is a stable
    `GraphTopologyEditError` for invalid indices, unsupported slots/templates,
    invalid delete ranges, and non-unary or non-single-consumer delete shapes.
- Latest full verification for current `main`:
  - `rtk moon fmt`
  - `rtk moon info`
  - `rtk moon check`
  - `rtk moon test`
  - `rtk moon build --target wasm-gc`
  - `rtk npm run test:browser`
  - `rtk git diff --check`

## Recommended Next Slice

1. Start Phase 6 design.

   The Phase 6 design should focus on stable IDs, incremental invalidation
   boundaries, and how pattern/DSP graph edits map onto existing result-typed
   control, hot-swap, topology, and bound voice-pool APIs.

## Acceptance Checks For API-Hardening Slices

- Run `rtk moon info` and review `.mbti` diffs for intentional public API
  changes.
- Run `rtk moon fmt`, `rtk moon check`, and `rtk moon test`.
- If root facade or browser-relevant graph APIs changed, run
  `rtk moon build --target wasm-gc`.
- Update `docs/salat-engine-technical-reference.md` first for graph
  runtime-control behavior changes.
